Potential ideas
################
- Use PIN to instrument memory accesses (malloc and free) and verify if there is some overlap with message buffers in Put / Get operatoprationss
- Calculate overlapping memory regions in Put / Get operations (see SyncChecker paper for some inspiration)

Done

Nasty_win
 - origin rank (store in window as attribute) check
 - set random name on window to identify the window check

PMPI Submit order
 - possible values: program order, random (default)
 - default: random
 - more fine-grained order? gag, gap, pag, pap (where p = mpi_put, g = mpi_get)
 - works only with the same target rank
 - works only when Submit Time = defer

PMPI Submit time
 - defer (default) 
 - fire_immediately
 - random

Idea: break MPI Basic Datatypes? check
